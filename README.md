# Bot created for the Thom Stargazer Memorial Guild.
### created for discord using the discord.py module

This is a small bot made for me and my friends. Not meant for any other servers.

Still a bit of a work in progress, some of the functions I wrote a long time ago and need to be updated. I am always looking to add more features and play around with it. 

To Do
-----

+ fix the problem with the bot getting stuck in voice commands
+ update image editing code
+ add function to generate a story from an LSTM trained on various things(multiple lstms or trained on multiple things)
