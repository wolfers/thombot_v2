# Bot created for the Thom Stargazer Memorial Guild.
### created for discord using discord.py

This is a small bot made for me and my friends. Not meant for any other servers.

Still a bit of a work in progress, some of the functions I wrote a long time ago and need to be updated. I am always looking to add more features and play around with it.
